  * Added context to repeatedly used strings (#101)
    I used pgettext to add context to some strings, that were used more than one times, like "low", "moderate" and "high".
    And also marked more strings as translatable: current weather, day max.
    This commit includes updated Polish translation.

  * Translation related patches (#108)
    * appdata: `translate=no` properties
    It appears that the appstream project no longer supports
    `translatable=no` properties, and gettext extract the
    `translatable=no` marked strings as translatable.
    I opened an issue to inform about the situation, but `translatable=no`
    properties are not accepted by developers. You can find the issue
    here: `https://github.com/ximion/appstream/issues/623`
    **Please test your script or string extraction process before merging this PR.**
    > In MetaInfo files, each individual paragraph of a description
    > (or enumerated entry) is translated individually, however,
    > you can only exclude the complete block from being translated
    > by adding `translate="no"` to the description element.
    Source: https://freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/sect-Quickstart-Translation.html
    * appdata: Add developer ID
    Flathub requires a developer tag and developer ID.
    > A developer tag with a name child tag must be present. Only one developer tag is allowed and the name tag also must be present only once in untranslated form.
    ```
    <developer id="tld.vendor">
      <name>Developer name</name>
    </developer>
    ```
    Source: https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/metainfo-guidelines/#name-summary-and-developer-name
    * i18n: Use C_ alias for pgettext
    That way it's easy to catch a translatable string.

  * data: add translate and vcs-browser url types.
    More information: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#tag-url

    Validated with the following command:
    appstreamcli validate --pedantic data/io.github.amit9838.weather.appdata.xml.in
  * data: Mark release descriptions as untranslatable.
    GNOME automatically excludes release descriptions on
    Damned Lies (GNOME Translation Platform). It's a good
    practice to follow the GNOME way.
    This can streamline the translation process, allowing translators
    to focus their efforts on more critical and user-facing aspects
    of the application.
